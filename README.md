# Logic-gate-using-conways-game-of-life
The Game of life is two dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours and the following tranitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

A gospers glider gun is a pattern founded by a group in MIT it generates a glider(spaceship pattern) every 120th generation.
Using those guns we designed "and" logic gate.AND gate logic states that if both the input conditions are True (logic 1) then only output will be true else whatsoever the input condition is output will always be False(logic 0).

1. 0 0 0
2. 0 1 0
3. 1 0 0
4. 1 1 1
